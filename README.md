# Recipe-App
As part of the Thinkful program, I created the Reipe App.
For this project, I was tasked with creating a React app that would allow users to create, read, update and delete recipes.
The data is displayed in a table, with the dish name, cuisine type, photo, ingredients, and preparation instructions.
The Recipe app allows users to create, delete and organize recipes.

I used React and GitHub for this project.
I hope to use this project in the future to demonstrate my abilities to work with rendering and state management using React.
